[Xamarin](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/) is a open source framework which enables us to develop cross-platform mobile applications using C#. Xamarin C#-shared code base enables us to write native Android, iOS and Windows apps with native user interfaces and share code accross multiple platforms. 

In this repository was written a simple e-commerce cross-platform mobile project. [Web project](https://github.com/falaybeg/AspNetMVC-InventoryManagement-WebApi) API was used for CRUD operations. The connection between mobile project and API was provided from published Microsoft Azure API project.
